# Adapt-QAOA
The notebook presents a full implementation of Adaptive QAOA (based on [Zhu et. al.](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033029)) using Qiskit. The method is a variant of traditional QAOA, where mixers are seperately chosen for each layer from an operator pool, based on the largest derivative.
